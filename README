modsec2sguil
============
Written by Victor Julien <victor@inliniac.net>


What is it?
-----------
It is a set of Perl scripts that enables you to add ModSecurity alerts to
go into the Sguil NSM system. It acts as an agent to Sguil.


Required software
-----------------
- Apache2
- ModSecurity 2 (1.9.4 may work but is untested)
- Sguil 0.7 server
- Perl
- IO::Socket::SSL library (on Debian/Ubuntu libio-socket-ssl-perl package)


Install/Usage
-------------

- Create a user to run the agent as -

Add a user with the following command:
# useradd -u 400 -d /home/sguil sguil

This creates a user called sguil. The specific uid is given so transfering
files between different sensors is easier. It is not required. Choose an
uid that is not already in use.


- Installation of files - 

You can place the two binary files (the .pl ones) anywhere you want. Since
I like having all files together I'm putting them in /nsm/bin. Place the
modsec_agent.conf in /nsm/etc

The two libraries (the .pm files) should be in /usr/lib/perl5/ (or use
a symlink for that.


- Agent configuration -

Modsec2sguil uses a configuation file that uses the same syntax as Sguil
agents. Take the example configution file and adapt it to your needs. It
is advisable to enable debugging and disable daemon mode while testing.

Set the RUNAS variable to the user you created above.

This doc assumes the configfile is placed in /nsm/etc


- Apache2 setup -

The following asumes your Apache2 logs to /var/log/apache2/ and
that ModSecurity2 concurrent logging will log to /var/log/apache2/audit_log/data/

Step 1. Creating a queue directory.

modsec_queue.pl adds the events to the queue directory so modsec_agent.pl can
process them in the right order. The directory can be anywhere but note that
when you intend to run modsec_agent.pl under reduced privileges (which is
highly recommended) the directory and it's parents need to be owned by the
user you want to run the agent as.

Create the directory /nsm/queue and set the correct permissions on it:
chown sguil /nsm -R

Step 2. Setup the Apache2/ModSecurity2 config

Put the following lines in your Apache2/ModSecurity2 configuration:

SecAuditLogType Concurrent
SecAuditLogStorageDir /var/log/apache2/audit_log/data/
SecAuditLog "|/path/to/modsec_queue.pl -c /nsm/etc/modsec_agent.conf /var/log/apache2/audit_log/data/ /var/log/apache2/audit_log/index"
SecAuditLogParts ABCDEFGHZ

NOTE: the SecAuditLog line changed from previous version of modsec2sguil!

Restart apache2. You should see event files appear in the queue directoy.
Depending on your setup they might appear on simple webserver visits or
you might have to run a tool like nikto to trigger events.

Look at you apache2 error log for any errors.


- Putting it together -

Next, use modsec_agent.pl to connect to Sguil. It is run as follows:
modsec_agent.pl -c /nsm/etc/modsec_agent.conf

The script enters an endless loop in which it will continuesly check for new
alert files in the queue dir. Press Ctrl-C to kill it. If everything works
fine, you can enable daemon mode.

Future plans / known limitations
-------------------------------
Better error checking.
Enable a way to log when running in daemon mode.
More docs.
Think of a name for this little project ;-)


Special thanks to
-----------------
Ivan Ristic of Breach Security for releasing modsec-auditlog-collector.pl as GPL.
And for creating ModSecurity of course!

Bamm Visscher for answering my endless questions. Of course, Sguil rocks,
so thanks for that as well.
